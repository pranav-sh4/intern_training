Depth: Utilization of Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter blurs) and semi-transparent surfaces to create a layered UI.

Typography: Hierarchical font system using Serif for impact, Sans-Serif for readability, and Monospace for technical metadata.

Technical Features

Desktop: Centered 70% content width for focused readability.

Mobile: Fluid 100% width with vertical grid stacking.

Scalability: Viewport-based typography using clamp() functions.

Interactive UI Components:

Glow Buttons: Hover states with cyan box-shadow transitions.

Table Matrices: Custom-styled data tables with glowing side-row indicators.
